# housing-regression-analysis Price Index Trends in Europe (2005–2024)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes housing price trends across 10 European countries between 2005 and 2024 using linear regression and trajectory visualization. It explores growth disparities, convergence effects, and the role of starting conditions in long-term market behavior.

## 🗃️ Dataset & Methodology

- **Source**: Eurostat – Housing Price Index (Base 2015 = 100)  
- **Timeframe**: 2005–2024  
- **Countries Included**: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland  
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

### Key Steps
- Data cleaning and selection of 10 countries
- Normalization using 2015 as baseline
- Cumulative growth calculation (2024 vs. 2005)
- Per-country regression analysis: Housing Index vs. Year
- Cross-sectional model: Initial Index (2005) → Growth
- Visualizations: bar charts, scatter plots, and trajectory graphs

## 📈 Key Findings

- Countries with lower housing price indices in 2005 (e.g., Luxembourg, Austria) showed higher cumulative growth rates.
- A clear inverse relationship was found between initial price levels and growth (R² = 0.835).
- Linear regression provides a consistent foundation, but visual trajectories uncover disruptions, volatility, and rebound phases.

## 💡 Insights & Implications

- Regression models are powerful tools for summarizing trends but must be supported by visual storytelling for deeper insight.
- Differences in national growth reflect not only economic strength but also institutional resilience and social policies.
- Policymakers can use these insights to anticipate overheating risks, underinvestment signals, or convergence trends.
